Mainframe is effectively the "main" of the application. It's primary responsibility is connecting
to the server, allowing the user to log in, fetching the modules available to the given user and
then allowing the user to use them. Functions as a finite state machine that moves between the
following states: "login" > "main_screen" > "module of choice". Besides that, the mainframe allows
the user to access their profile and choose which widgets they want to have.

The main directory stores files essential to the main app flow, including the widgets through which
it is rendered (almost no data is stored in these files however)

The user directory stores files needed to store information about a single user, most importantly
their profile information, functions, the school they are attached to and the modules available
to them.
